# breakout-thing
A Breakout game app for DeskThing running on the depreciated (but now revitalized) Spotify Car Thing.

I'm still learning the ins and outs of the DeskThing server, client, and app communication. Please have patience. If you would like to contribute or have any comments, don't hesitate to reach out. You can contact me on the [deskthing discord server](https://discord.gg/deskthing-1267348109067817051) or even start a discussion on the breakout github page. Cheers!!
